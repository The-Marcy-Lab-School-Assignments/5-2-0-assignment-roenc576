# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer

Polymorphism is a principle in object-oriented programming that lets objects of different classes to be bound together by a common `super` class. In the example below, the `Animal` super class is what ties the `Dog` and `Cat` classes together. 
```js
class Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} makes a sound :0`);
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        super(name);
    }

    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} barks :D`);
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    constructor(name) {
        super(name);
    }

    speak() {
        console.log(`${this.name} meows :3`);
    }
}

const animals = [
    new Dog('Rufus'),
    new Cat('Chelsea'),
    new Animal('GenericAnimal')
];

animals.forEach(animal => {
    animal.speak(); // Polymorphic behavior: each call to speak() behaves according to the object's actual class
});
```
